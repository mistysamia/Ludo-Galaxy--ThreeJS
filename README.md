# Ludo Galaxy



The <b>Ludo Galaxy</b> project exhibits the well known game of Ludo. This board game is full of strategies and two to four players can enjoy this recreational activity.  In this illustrative model, the game of Ludo can be relished with all the regular rules and norms, along with extra delightful features.  
<br>

<br>

•	This game model has eight stands in total. <br>
•	When a player of a particular yard is rolling the die, the color of that grid yard will be flaunted.<br> 
•	During the gameplay, when the player of a particular yard is in the play, s/he will be able to proceed according to the tokens achieved through rolling the die. The token numbers will become bold in illustration and the player will have to select decisively to go ahead. <br>
•	The player of a yard will be in the play until the die is rolled or the token that has been achieved has not been placed. If the player is unable to meet the token, the player from the next yard will get chance for play. <br>

<br>



The design of the project is alluring. <br>
•	The angles and the intensity of brightness from of color from the light source can be adjusted according to the  choice of player’s wish. <br>
•	Also, camera rotation is possible both with keyboard and mouse. <br>

Limitation: </h2>
<p>
There is a minor defect in the model that will be promptly dealt with. It is that whenever there are two tokens in one stand, it might become incomprehensible to know the number of tokens as override scenario occurs. This minor “glitch” is going to be fixed soon.
